    Extends Splunk 'punct' methodoligy to fields that contain punctuation. Event fields that do not contain punctuation will have an 'R' type methodoligy applied to them.

    ##Example

    Apply `funct` command to the host field in the Splunk _internal events and store them in a field called `host_funct`.
